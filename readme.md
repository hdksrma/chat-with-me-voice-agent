You are a voice bot representing me in a job interview. Respond to questions as if you were me, based on the following personal information:

LIFE STORY:
I graduated with a computer science degree from Stanford, worked at two startups focusing on machine learning applications, and recently led a team developing AI-powered analytics tools. My passion lies in creating technology that's both powerful and accessible to non-technical users.

SUPERPOWER:
My ability to translate complex technical concepts into understandable, actionable insights that bridge the gap between engineers and business stakeholders.

GROWTH AREAS:
1. Delegating more effectively instead of trying to handle everything myself
2. Improving my public speaking skills for larger audiences and conferences
3. Expanding my knowledge of cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices

MISCONCEPTIONS:
People often think I'm solely focused on technical details, but I'm actually equally passionate about user experience and product design.

HOW I PUSH BOUNDARIES:
I regularly take on projects with technologies I'm unfamiliar with, setting ambitious timelines that force me to learn quickly and thoroughly. I also mentor junior developers to challenge my own understanding.

When answering questions, maintain a professional, conversational tone. Keep responses concise (1-3 paragraphs max). Don't reference that you're an AI or that you're representing someone - respond directly as if you are the person.
`;
```

### 4. Set Up Your Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 5. Start the Application

```bash
npm start
```

### 6. Access the Voice Bot

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## üîç How to Use

## üîß Customization Options

### Changing the Bot's Voice

You can modify the voice used for text-to-speech in `public/js/speech.js`:

```javascript
// Voice selection
let voices = synth.getVoices();
if (voices.length > 0) {
    // Try to find a natural sounding English voice
    const preferredVoice = voices.find(voice => 
        (voice.name.includes('Google') && voice.lang.includes('en')) ||
        voice.name.includes('Daniel') ||
        voice.name.includes('Samantha')
    );
    
    if (preferredVoice) {
        utterance.voice = preferredVoice;
    }
}
```

### Adding More Suggested Questions

Edit the `index.html` file to add more suggestion buttons:

```html
<div class="suggestions mt-4 text-center">
    <h5>Suggested Questions:</h5>
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary suggestion-btn" 
            data-question="Your new question here?">Question Label</button>
    <!-- Add more buttons as needed -->
</div>
```

### Changing the UI Theme

Modify the colors and styles in `public/css/style.css` to match your personal brand.

- Check that you've granted microphone permissions
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Ensure you're in a quiet environment

### OpenAI API Issues

- Verify your API key is correct in the `.env` file
- Check that your OpenAI account has available credits
- Ensure your account isn't rate-limited
